# Changelog

All notable changes to Forgeline. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/),
and versions follow [Semantic Versioning](docs/guides/versioning.md). Change the `Unreleased`
section in the pull request that makes the change; a release moves it under its version and date.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Workflows.** Stages of agents run in order; steps in a stage run together; a stage can wait
  for an administrator; a workflow can run on an interval. Each step runs an agent at a version
  pinned when the workflow was saved, with each stage's output handed to the next as data. An
  unattended run is capped at developer (never an administrator) and anything it proposes still needs
  a person. Versioned like skills and agents, with run history, cancel, and recovery after a restart.
  (note 017)
- **Skills and agents with versions.** A skill is a procedure; an agent is instructions, pinned
  skill versions, a tool allowlist and a tier (T0 advises, T1 may file proposals). Every save is a
  new immutable version with a fingerprint, history, diff and rollback. The assistant can hand a
  task to an agent (`ask_agent`); an agent never calls another agent and never gets more than the
  person asking could do. (note 017)
- **Several AWS accounts.** Add read-only accounts by profile and region; switch between them in
  the console; the explorer, spend and the assistant read any of them. Changes stay on the primary
  account. (note 017)
- **AWS resource explorer** and the `aws_resources` lookup: every service in an account with state,
  search, detail, and what Forgeline changed there.
- **AWS MCP Server.** Read lookups, change proposals and four-eyes approval that applies exactly the
  approved script (note 016); the Proposals page.
- **Assistant lookups** (runs, logs, pipelines, AWS, audit) and a read-only `call_aws`
  (note 015).

### Changed
